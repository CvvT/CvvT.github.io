Weiteng Chen is a fifth-year PhD candidate from University of California, Riverside. So far he has published three papers in the top-tier security conferences as the lead author. His research focuses on OS security and vulnerability analysis. He is particularly interested in exploitability assessment and kernel fuzzing. 
In his first project, he discovered a timing side channel inherent in all generations of Wi-Fi technology, which could be leveraged to hijack users’ connections to web services, leading to cache poisoning attacks. His second project aimed to assess the severity of a Linux OOB write vulnerability by attempting to automatically generate a corresponding PoC that could achieve IP hijacking demonstrating the need for an immediate fix. In his last work, Weiteng designed and developed SyzGen capable of extracting both structures and constraints of syscall arguments, as well as dependencies between syscalls, which is complementary to the kernel fuzzing tool, Syzkaller, since it requires manual work to develop syscall specifications. By evaluating SyzGen against 25 macOS drivers, it has found 34 bugs, 5 of which have been assigned CVE to date. Besides, he won IRTF 2019 Applied Networking Research Prize and a $15,000 award at GeekPwn International Security Geek Contest 2017 Silicon Valley. He has also spoken at events including Linux Summer Summit 2021, CCS 2021, USENIX Security’20, IRTF Open Meeting 2019, and USENIX Security’18.
